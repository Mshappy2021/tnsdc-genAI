# Traffic Sign recognition
Design and train a CNN model using Keras to effectively classify traffic signs from a labeled image dataset.

Achieve high accuracy in recognizing a diverse set of traffic signs, including variations in size, color, and lighting conditions.

Explore techniques for improving model robustness to real-world challenges like occlusions and varying image quality.
